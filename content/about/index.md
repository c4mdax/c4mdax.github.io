## About Me

I'm a **Computer Science** student at [Faculty of Sciences, UNAM](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultad_de_Ciencias_(Universidad_Nacional_Aut%C3%B3noma_de_M%C3%A9xico)) (3rd Semester).

I have a genuine interest and curiosity in **Theoretical Computing** related to **Artificial Intelligence**.  That is why, for not long now, I have been dedicating myself to studying this field to eventually dedicate my life to **ML Engineering**.

Despite not yet having a specific focus on a field of Artificial Intelligence, I can highlight curiosity and taste in **Probability Theory**, **Computer Vision**, **Data Processing** and its behavior with generative models, and, of course, **Algoritmia**. In addition to the field of AI, I have been studying and improving to **Backend Development** and **Software Development**.

In my free time, I usually see content related to dilemmas or intrigues related to AI, which is why I decided to create a [Papers](../papers/) section where I intend to share papers or publications that I find related to this wonderful field of computing.
