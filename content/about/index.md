## About Me

I'm a 4th semester student of **Computer Science** at [Faculty of Sciences, UNAM](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultad_de_Ciencias_(Universidad_Nacional_Aut%C3%B3noma_de_M%C3%A9xico)).

I have a genuine interest in the theory of **Artificial Intelligence** (from the Theoretical-Practical part to the Philosophical-Humanistic part), as well as a taste for **Software Development** with **Machine Learning implementations**, therefore, since 2024 I have been studying everything related to the **Machine Learning Engineer** path (following this [Roadmap](https://github.com/C4mdax/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Roadmap/ROADMAP.md)).

In my free time, I usually wander through publications, papers or topics related to the semantics of AI, from which I usually rescue interesting information for [Posts](../posts/) (I also use this section for my study). Generally I write my posts in Spanish, because I enjoy writing in my language. I write some other things in English, because I need to improve hehe.
