## About Me

I'm a 4th semester student of **Computer Science** at [Faculty of Sciences, UNAM](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultad_de_Ciencias_(Universidad_Nacional_Aut%C3%B3noma_de_M%C3%A9xico)).

I'm passionate about **Software Development** with **Machine Learning implementations**, focusing on building scalable and efficient applications. My interests include **Backend Development**, **MLOps**, and integrating ML into real-world products. I also enjoy exploring **Computer Vision**, **Data Processing**, and the intersection of ML with Software Engineering.

In my free time, I usually wander through publications, papers or topics related to the semantics of AI, from which I usually rescue interesting information for [Posts](../posts/). Generally I write my posts in Spanish, because I enjoy writing in my language. I write some other things in English, because I need to improve hehe.
