## About Me

I'm a 4th semester student of **Computer Science** at [Faculty of Sciences, UNAM](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facultad_de_Ciencias_(Universidad_Nacional_Aut%C3%B3noma_de_M%C3%A9xico)).

I have a genuine interest and curiosity for the field related to **Artificial Intelligence**.  That's why, for not long now, I've been dedicating myself to studying this field to eventually dedicate my life to **ML Engineering**.

Despite not yet having a specific focus on a field of Artificial Intelligence, I can highlight curiosity and taste in **Probability Theory**, **Computer Vision**, **Data Processing** and its behavior with generative models, **LLM's Theory**,  and, of course, **Algoritmia**. In addition to the field of AI, I've been studying and improving to **Backend Development** and **Software Development** with basic ML implementations.

In my free time, I usually wander through publications, papers or topics related to the semantics of AI, from which I usually rescue interesting information for [Posts](../posts/). Generally I write my posts in Spanish, because I enjoy writing in my language. I write some other things in English, because I need to improve hehe.
